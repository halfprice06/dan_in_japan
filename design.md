# Design Document for Vacation Photo Website

## Overview
This document outlines the design and implementation plan for a personal website that hosts vacation photos. The website leverages **AI** to generate captions for each photo and enhances interactivity by utilizing image metadata such as GPS coordinates and date taken.

## Project Goals
1. **AI-Generated Captions**: Use a visual language model to generate descriptive captions for each photo.
2. **Interactive Map**: Display photos on an interactive map based on their GPS metadata.
3. **Sorting and Filtering**: Allow users to sort photos by date and search by location.
4. **Responsive Design**: Ensure the website is accessible and user-friendly across devices.

## Technologies Used

### Backend
- **Python**
- **FastAPI**: Framework for building the web application.
- **SQLite**: Database for storing photo metadata and captions.
- **Anthropic Claude API**: Used to generate AI-based captions for photos.

### Frontend
- **HTMX**: For enhancing interactivity without extensive JavaScript.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Jinja2 Templates**: For rendering dynamic HTML content.

### Image Processing
- **Pillow (PIL)**: For extracting EXIF data from images.
- **Anthropic Claude API**: For generating captions.
- **Requests**: For making HTTP requests.

### Interactive Map
- **Leaflet.js**: JavaScript library for interactive maps.
- **Leaflet.markercluster**: Plugin for clustering map markers.
- **OpenStreetMap Tiles**: Map tiles for rendering the map.

## Instructions for Future Development
To guide future development, particularly for an AI that will continue building the project, consider the following instructions:

1. **Implement the Visual Language Model Integration**
    - **Objective**: Complete the `generate_caption(image_path)` function in `process_images.py` to generate captions using a visual language model.
    - **Steps**:
        - Choose an appropriate pre-trained model (e.g., models available on Hugging Face).
        - Ensure the model can run efficiently, possibly using GPU acceleration if available.
        - Update the function to input an image file and output a descriptive caption.
        - Handle exceptions and edge cases where the model might fail to generate a caption.

2. **Optimize Image Processing**
    - **Goal**: Improve the efficiency and reliability of the `process_images.py` script.
    - **Recommendations**:
        - Implement logging to monitor the processing of each image.
        - Add error handling for files that cannot be processed.
        - Consider multithreading or asynchronous processing to handle multiple images concurrently.
        - Resize images to appropriate dimensions for web display to optimize load times.

3. **Enhance the Frontend Interactivity**
    - **Objective**: Improve user experience with additional interactive features.
    - **Suggestions**:
        - Use HTMX to implement live search and filtering without page reloads.
        - Add modals or lightbox functionality for viewing images in larger formats.
        - Implement responsive design patterns to ensure the site works well on mobile devices.

4. **Improve Map Functionality**
    - **Tasks**:
        - Fine-tune the clustering behavior using Leaflet.markercluster to enhance performance with large numbers of markers.
        - Customize marker icons to visually differentiate types of locations or to match the site's theme.
        - Add tooltips or additional information in the popups, such as the date taken or location name.
        - Consider integrating additional map layers or controls for better user interaction.

5. **Implement Reverse Geocoding**
    - **Purpose**: Convert GPS coordinates into human-readable location names.
    - **Action Items**:
        - Complete the `get_location_name(lat, lon)` function in `process_images.py` using a reverse geocoding service.
        - Update the database schema in `setup_database.py` to include a `location_name` field:
        
            ```sql
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS photo (
                id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
                file_path TEXT NOT NULL,
                caption TEXT,
                date_taken TEXT,
                latitude REAL,
                longitude REAL,
                location_name TEXT,
                exif_data TEXT
            )
            ```
        
        - Store the location names when processing images.
        - Update `index.html` to display the location names instead of raw coordinates.

6. **Security and Privacy Considerations**
    - **Recommendations**:
        - Obfuscate exact GPS coordinates if privacy is a concern (e.g., rounding coordinates).
        - Ensure that any API keys or secrets used (e.g., for geocoding services) are securely stored and not exposed in the codebase.
        - Consider implementing user authentication if the website should not be publicly accessible.
        - Validate and sanitize any user inputs to prevent injection attacks.

7. **Deployment Planning**
    - **Objective**: Prepare the application for deployment to a production environment.
    - **Considerations**:
        - Containerize the application using Docker for consistent deployment.
        - Use a production-ready web server like Uvicorn with Gunicorn (`UvicornWorker`) behind a reverse proxy like Nginx.
        - Set up HTTPS using SSL certificates (e.g., Let's Encrypt).
        - Configure environment variables for configuration settings and secrets.
        - Implement automated deployment scripts or use CI/CD pipelines.

8. **Codebase Enhancement**
    - **Suggestions**:
        - Refactor code to adhere to PEP 8 style guidelines.
        - Add docstrings and comments for functions and classes.
        - Write unit tests for critical functions, especially for image processing and database interactions.
        - Organize code into modules or packages if the codebase grows.

9. **Monitor Performance and Scalability**
    - **Tasks**:
        - Profile the application to identify and address performance bottlenecks.
        - Implement caching strategies for database queries and API calls.
        - Optimize database indexes and queries for faster data retrieval.
        - Plan for scaling the application if needed (e.g., migrating to a more robust database system like PostgreSQL).

10. **Documentation and Maintenance**
    - **Recommendations**:
        - Maintain up-to-date documentation for setup, configuration, and deployment processes.
        - Create a README file with instructions on how to run and contribute to the project.
        - Document any third-party services or APIs used, including usage limits and authentication requirements.
        - Establish coding standards and guidelines for consistency.
